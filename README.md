In this project, we've built an interactive Streamlit app that allows users to chat with a chatbot capable of searching the web, querying arXiv for academic papers, and fetching information from Wikipedia. Here's a brief summary of what the code does:

### Imports and Setup:

We import necessary libraries like streamlit, langchain_groq for the Groq API, and various tools from langchain_community for arXiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo search.

We also import initialize_agent from langchain.agents to create an agent that can use these tools, and StreamlitCallbackHandler to display the agent's thought process in the Streamlit app.

### Tool Initialization:

We initialize tools for arXiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo search with specific configurations like limiting the number of results and the maximum content length.

### Streamlit App Interface:

The app has a title and a sidebar where users can input their Groq API key.

The chat interface is set up using st.chat_input for user input and st.chat_message to display messages.

### Session State Management:

We use st.session_state to store chat messages, ensuring the conversation persists across interactions.

### Agent Initialization and Execution:

When a user inputs a query, the app initializes a Groq-powered language model (ChatGroq) and sets up an agent with the tools.

The agent processes the user's query, using the tools to fetch relevant information, and displays the results in the chat interface.

The StreamlitCallbackHandler is used to show the agent's thought process and actions in real-time.

### Response Handling:

The agent's response is appended to the session state and displayed in the chat interface.

In summary, this project creates a conversational AI agent that can interact with users, perform web searches, and retrieve information from arXiv and Wikipedia, all within a Streamlit app. The agent's actions and thought process are visualized in real-time, making the interaction transparent and engaging.
